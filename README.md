## Next step

Need a black screen
the blank screen should be able to render next dimension. Next dimension is 2 dimension. The first blank screen is one dimenstion ? no, go one step before. first blank screen is zero dimension, one dimension, two dimension. 

Dammit, what is this ? I solved taking time as the fundamental dimension this seems to be tricky.

Forget time, space, marvel theory of universe.

pick what you wrote,

figured out a fact - Blank screen can be of any dimension, at higher dimension, it can be self aware. hmm hmm.

Its too much, one step at a time, 

Given facts, monitor is single dimesion (dark) monitor is two dimension (height and width) and it can go on.

Stop chit chatting and get to the point - 

Write the "Connect the dots, millions dude" program.
